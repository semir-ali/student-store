  - [X] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: Use Prisma Studio to demonstrate the creation of all attributes (table columns) in your Order Model.

- [X] **Order Items Model**
  - [X] Develop a model to represent the items within an order.

  - [X] Implement methods for fetching and creating order items.  
  - [X] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: Use Prisma Studio to demonstrate the creation of all attributes (table columns) in your Order Items Model.
- [X] **API Endpoints**
  - [X] Application supports the following **Product Endpoints**:
    - [X] `GET /products`: Fetch a list of all products.
    - [X] `GET /products/:id`: Fetch details of a specific product by its ID.
    - [X] `POST /products`: Add a new product to the database.
    - [X] `PUT /products/:id`: Update the details of an existing product.
    - [X] `DELETE /products/:id`: Remove a product from the database.
  - [X] Application supports the following **Order Endpoints**:
    - [X] `GET /orders`: Fetch a list of all orders.
    - [X] `GET /orders/:order_id`: Fetch details of a specific order by its ID, including the order items.
    - [X] `POST /orders`: Create a new order with specified order items.
    - [X] `PUT /orders/:order_id`: Update the details of an existing order (e.g., change status).
    - [X] `DELETE /orders/:order_id`: Remove an order from the database.
    - [X] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: Use Postman or another API testing tool to demonstrate the successful implementation of each endpoint. For the `DELETE` endpoints, please use Prisma Studio to demonstrate that any relevant order items have been deleted. 
- [X] **Frontend Integration**
  - [X] Connect the backend API to the provided frontend interface, ensuring dynamic interaction for product browsing, cart management, and order placement. Adjust the frontend as necessary to work with your API.
  - [X] Ensure the home page displays products contained in the product table.
  - [X] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: Use `npm start` to run your server and display your website in your browser. 
    - [X] Demonstrate that users can successfully add items to their shopping cart, delete items from their shopping cart, and place an order
    - [X] After placing an order use Postman or Prisma Studio demonstrate that a corresponding order has been created in your orders table.

### Stretch Features

- [X] **Added Endpoints**
  - [X] `GET /order-items`: Create an endpoint for fetching all order items in the database.
  - [X] `POST /orders/:order_id/items` Create an endpoint that adds a new order item to an existing order. 
- [X] **Past Orders Page**
  - [X] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders.
  - [X] The page lists all past orders for the user, including relevant information such as:
    - [X] Order ID
    - [X] Date

    - [X] List of order items
    - [X] Order item quantities
    - [X] Individual order item costs
    - [X] Total order cost
- [X] **Filter Orders**.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs helped me especially with understanding how Prisma and PostgreSQL works for handling data. This was essential for creating the Product, Order, and OrderItem models since it gave me the experience making these models for other objects (in the lab's case, pets, for instance). It also helped me with using Postman since it taught me how to save requests which I could use. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added the ability to have user accounts. These accounts also could create their own products associated with them (like Amazon where users can be their own product owners) and products displayed on the websites can have associated with their owners. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think for my project demo, I was able to explicitly describe how the project works from both a backend and frontend perspective, and show the user story from one time to another.
